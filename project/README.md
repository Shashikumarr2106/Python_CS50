Simple Banking Application: A Python Project
The Simple Banking Application is a Python project that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, object-oriented design, and interactive user input handling. The goal of this project is to create a minimalistic banking application that allows users to interact with a bank account by making deposits, withdrawals, and checking their account balance.

Project Structure:
project.py:
This file contains the core implementation of the banking application. It defines a BankAccount class representing a bank account and a main() function to demonstrate the functionalities.

BankAccount Class:
The BankAccount class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a bank account. It includes methods to deposit funds, withdraw funds, and retrieve the account balance.

main() Function:
The main() function serves as the entry point to the application. It showcases how users can interact with their bank account by making deposits, withdrawals, and checking their balance.

test_project.py:
This file contains unit tests for the BankAccount class methods to ensure their correctness and reliability. The unit tests validate the behavior of deposit, withdrawal, and balance retrieval operations.

requirements.txt:
This file specifies the project's requirements, primarily including the pytest library for running the unit tests.

Functionality:
BankAccount Class:

The BankAccount class initializes with a balance (defaulted to 0) and provides methods to deposit and withdraw funds.
__init__(self, initial_balance=0) initializes the account with an initial balance.
deposit(self, amount) allows users to deposit a specified amount into the account.
withdraw(self, amount) enables users to withdraw a specified amount, checking for sufficient funds before processing the withdrawal.
get_balance(self) retrieves the current account balance.
Main Function (main()):

The main() function showcases the application's capabilities by demonstrating the creation of a bank account, making deposits, withdrawals, and displaying the account balance.
Users are prompted to input deposit and withdrawal amounts, and the application calculates and displays the account balance accordingly.
Importance of the Project:
Fundamental Programming Concepts:

This project illustrates foundational programming concepts, including classes, methods, user input handling, and conditional statements.
Object-Oriented Design:

The project adopts an object-oriented approach, where a BankAccount class models a bank account's behavior and properties, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Interactive User Experience:

The application provides an interactive experience, allowing users to simulate banking actions such as depositing and withdrawing funds, offering a hands-on understanding of software interaction.
Testing and Reliability:

The inclusion of unit tests ensures the correctness and reliability of the code, fostering good testing practices and aiding in identifying potential issues early in development.
Educational Value:

This project serves as a learning tool, demonstrating the application of programming fundamentals in a practical context, making it an ideal starting point for Python beginners.
In conclusion, the Simple Banking Application project provides a straightforward yet insightful introduction to Python programming, emphasizing essential concepts and practices, making it an excellent learning resource for those looking to grasp the basics of programming and software development.
